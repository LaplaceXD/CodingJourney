# Progression

## Programming 1
1. To be filled.

## Programming 2
1. `typedef`
2. Dynamic Allocation
    1. `malloc()`
    2. `calloc()`
    3. `free()`
    4. `realloc()`
3. Structs

## DSA
1. Lists
    1. Variations
        1. ArrayList
        2. LinkedList
        3. Cursor-Based List
    2. Methods
        1. Display
        2. Utilities
            1. `isFull()`
            2. `isEmpty()`
        3. Insert
            1. `insertFirst()`
            2. `insertLast()`
            3. `insertSorted()`
        4. Remove
            1. `removeFirst()`
            2. `removeLast()`
            3. `removeElem()`
